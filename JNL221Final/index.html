        <h1>HOW LUCK IN THE NBA DRAFT LOTTERY TRANSLATES TO WINNING </h1>

        <p class="dek">In this story, NBA teams who moved into the top three of the NBA Draft lottery from 2005 to 2019 will be analyzed by their performance the next five seasons to see how much the good luck played into their success.</p>

        <p>Luck, it's a weird thing in sports. It comes in many different ways, double-doinks, coin tosses, foul calls, it's what many people love about it, and what causes so much heartbreak.</p>

        <p>In the NBA, luck isn't just about where a ball bounces or if the ref calls a flagrant or personal foul in the final moments, it's also about ping pong balls. Every May, NBA teams gather around to hear the results of the NBA draft lottery, which dictates what pick each team is going to receive in the upcoming draft.</p>

        <p> From 2005 to 2019, 25 teams leapfrogged their way into the top-3 of the NBA lottery or moved higher up in the top-3 of the lottery. In that span, team's with the fortunate luck averaged almost three playoff appearances and three-and-a-half series victories in the five years following the fortunate draft luck.<p> 

        <P> While many teams had fortunate playoff success, and every one made the playoffs at least once in the following five seasons, only the Boston Celtics, Oklahoma City Thunder, Los Angeles Lakers and Cleveland Cavaliers made NBA Finals appearances. Just the Cavaliers and Lakers won the championship; both titles were spearheaded by basketball legend LeBron James.<p>

        <p> Unsurprisingly, teams showed major progression throughout the seasons in record. In the first year after their fortunate luck, teams won on average around 45% of their games, in their fifth season after, they won about 54% of their contests. With 53% of the league making the playoffs every season, the fact that team's made the postseason about 58% of the time and averaged multiple playoff series wins in that span highlights how teams have a slight advantage in the following five seasons if they move up into the top-3 of the lottery.<p>


        <p> While it wasn't in the five-year window of the data study, the Boston Celtics won a championship seven years after moving up in the lottery, in main part due to their draft pick in that lottery, Jayson Tatum, who led the team in scoring and was a first-team all-nba selection during their title season. <p>

        <p> While the draft isn't everything, teams with unfortunate success in other parts of their roster building can use the draft to grow talent.</p>

        <p> There's a lot that goes into roster building, with options to trade, sign or draft players, many teams go about team building in many different ways. If they are not fortunate with their draft odds, they may look to go in different directions to fill out a squad.<p>

        <p>"NBA teams typically have an ordered set of roster priorities," said <a href="https://falk.syr.edu/people/sandersshane/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shane Sanders</a>, a Sports Analytics professor at Syracuse University. "If those priorities aren't served well in the Draft, they become more active in the free agency market."</p>

        <p>While luck isn't everything, and the data can't display what teams got the luckiest calls, and the best signings, teams that moved up at least six spots in the lottery, all but two made at least the second round of the playoffs in the following five seasons. </p>

        <p>The fact that teams perform better when they have a higher draft pick should be no surprise. As displayed in a paper in the  <a href="file:///Users/holdensherman/Downloads/1-s2.0-S2214635024001175-main.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Journal of Behavioral and Experimental Finance</a>, written by Sports Management and economics professors <a href="https://falk.syr.edu/people/sandersshane/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shane Sanders</a>, <a href="https://falk.syr.edu/people/ehrlich-justin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Justin Ehrlich</a> and <a href="https://ung.edu/mike-cottrell-college-of-business/faculty-staff-bio/joel-potter.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Joel Potter</a>, there is a direct correlation between number of wins in the following four seasons and pick number. The higher the draft pick, the more wins are usually produced.</p>

        <p>Some of the players that NBA teams have been able to select with their high picks are or were all-nba selections, like Tatum, or they were able to trade to receive other high-caliber players such as Kevin Love,<a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/11397368/kevin-love-traded-minnesota-timberwolves-cleveland-cavaliers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> whom the Cleveland Cavaliers traded for after unexpectedly getting the first overall pick in the draft two consecutive seasons,</a> moving a total 10 spots in the two lotteries. The acquisition of love helped the Cavaliers win the 2015-2016 NBA Finals. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC-mTgXRfm8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">His defense on Golden State Warriors All-Star Stephen Curry at the end of Game 7 is considered one of the most significant plays in the deciding game.</a></p>

        <p><iframe title="Sum of Playoff Series Won" aria-label="Dot Plot" id="datawrapper-chart-XNZrL" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/XNZrL/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="373" data-external="1"></iframe><p>

        <p>Of course, there are times when having good luck does not translate to better team success. If a squad misses on a high draft pick and the player that they select does not turn out as they are expected to, a team may still struggle like the Sacramento Kings did after drafting Marvin Bagley III in 2018.</p>


        <p><a href="https://www.nba.com/news/nba-draft-lottery-explainer"> While the odds of receiving a high draft pick have changed in the past 20 and the worst team's chances at receiving a high pick are not as good as they once used to be,</a> having a high pick still remains a prized possession. <p>

        <p>With terrific NBA prospects like Cooper Flagg and AJ Dybansta set to be drafted in the upcoming years, as the data shows, if an NBA teams jumps into the top part of the NBA lottery, they could be setting themselves up for success not only for the upcoming season, but for seasons to come.</p>
